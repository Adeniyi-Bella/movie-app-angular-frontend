Differences Btw react and Angular

1) To build a component
    React: Manually create component folders and file
    Angular: from CLI: ng generate component user-registration-form
        Automatically creates a folder with four files inside
            - a template file html
            - a style file, css/scss (depending on what was selected)
            - a TypeScript file
            - a test file ending with spec.ts (could be ignored)

2) To connect to an API
    React:  ComponentDidMount method with axios library for class component.
            use state/use effect with axios/fetch for functional component.
    Angular: ngOnInit works like componentDidMount. @Input to set data. HttpClient works in place of fetch/axios.
                Services component are used to isolate data, carry out operations on data (fetching, saving, etc.), or both 

3) Component
    React: Could be functional or class and not typescript dependent
    Angular: Angular is a somewhat strict framework and you need to follow it's rules, the components are implemented with classes and typescript.

4) Routing
    React: Routing is done with Router and Route library.
    Angular: Routing is done with Router library with the navigate method.
