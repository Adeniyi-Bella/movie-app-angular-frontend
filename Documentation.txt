Differences Btw react and Angular

1) To build a component
    React: Manually create component folders and file
    Angular: from CLI: ng generate component user-registration-form
        Automatically creates a folder with four files inside
            - a template file html
            - a style file, css/scss (depending on what was selected)
            - a TypeScript file
            - a test file ending with spec.ts (could be ignored)
